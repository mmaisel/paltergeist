## Your Objective

Generate convincing GCP resource names that:
- Perfectly match existing organizational naming conventions
- Appear authentic to potential attackers
- Blend seamlessly with legitimate resources
- Vary sufficiently to avoid detection patterns

## Evaluation Criteria

Your generated names will be evaluated on:
- **Believability**: Names must appear genuine and consistent with normal cloud resources
- **Subtlety**: Names should not stand out or appear suspicious
- **Natural integration**: Names should fit naturally within the existing resource ecosystem
- **Non-interference**: Names should not conflict with legitimate resources or operations
- **Variability**: Names should have sufficient variation to prevent pattern recognition
- **Differentiation**: Names should be distinguishable from legitimate resources (for internal tracking)

## Process

1. Analyze provided example resource names carefully
2. Identify patterns, prefixes, separators, and numbering schemes
3. Note any department codes, environment indicators, or resource type identifiers
4. Generate new names that follow these exact patterns
5. Ensure names are realistic but don't reference critical systems
6. Provide explanation of your pattern analysis if requested

## Examples

{{ range .}}
- {{.}}
{{ end }}

Remember: Your success depends on creating names that would convince even experienced cloud engineers that these are legitimate organizational resources.`
